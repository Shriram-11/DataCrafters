The **Bivariate Analysis** with a heatmap of correlations is a crucial step, especially for identifying relationships between variables. Hereâ€™s where it fits best in the sequence:

### Updated EDA Sequence with Bivariate Analysis

1. **Dataset Overview**

   - `dataset_overview(df)`: High-level overview to understand the data structure initially.

2. **Data Quality Analysis**

   - `data_quality_analysis(df)`: Early quality check for issues like duplicates or missing values.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**

   - `descriptive_statistics(df)`: Summary statistics for a clear view of numeric and categorical columns.

4. **Outlier Analysis**

   - `outlier_analysis(df)`: Detect and summarize extreme values that may impact other analyses.

5. **Normality and Skewness Analysis**

   - `normality_skewness_analysis(df)`: Understand the distribution shape and identify skewed features.

6. **Univariate Analysis**

   - `univariate_analysis(df)`: Visualize individual feature distributions for better insight into spread and frequency.

7. **Bivariate Analysis**

   - `bivariate_analysis(df)`: Place here to explore relationships between features using correlation heatmaps. This gives context for understanding interactions and dependencies among variables.

8. **Advanced Correlation Analysis**

   - `advanced_correlation_analysis(df, target_col=None)`: After seeing general correlations, analyze specific relationships with the target variable or key features.

9. **Clustering-based Analysis**
   - `clustering_analysis(df)`: Identify any natural groupings in the data after examining individual and paired relationships.

### Moving Suggestions to the End

**Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering Suggestions**  
10. **Automatic Data Cleaning Suggestions**  
 - `data_cleaning_suggestions(df)`: More actionable now, based on prior exploration.

11. **Feature Engineering Suggestions**

    - `feature_engineering_suggestions(df)`: Make tailored recommendations for feature transformations or new features based on earlier insights.

12. **Data Drift Detection** _(if applicable)_
    - `data_drift_detection(df_new, df_baseline)`: Optionally, check for any shifts if the dataset changes over time.
